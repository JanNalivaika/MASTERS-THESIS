@article{Abele.2012,
 abstract = {Industrial robots are used in a great variety of applications for handling, welding and milling operations. They represent a cost-saving and flexible alternative for machining applications. A reduced pose and path accuracy, especially under process force load due to the high mechanical compliance, restrict the use of industrial robots for further machining applications. Test results showed that these deviations range up to 0.6{\&}nbsp;mm. In this paper, a method is presented to determine the resulting path deviation of the robot under process force by using a structured light scanner. The obtained data is compared with the CAD (Computer Aided Design) data of the machined part within a developed software module. Additionally, the developed module provides functions for manipulation, registration of STL (Surface Tessellation Language) surface point clouds and a postprocessor for program translation. The comparison is performed using a dexel discretization of each data set. Based on this comparison the robot path is adapted to improve the machining quality. This method can be applied to 3- and 5-axis machining operations. The results show that the deviation can be reduced to 0.1{\&}nbsp;mm.},

@article{Altintas.2001,
 abstract = {9R15. Manufacturing Automation: Metal Cutting Mechanics, Machine Tool Vibrations, and CNC Design. - Y Altintas (Manuf Autom Lab, Univ of British Columbia, Canada). Cambridge UP, Cambridge, UK. 2000. 286 pp. Softcover. ISBN 0-521-65973-6. {\$}39.95.Reviewed by AA Ber (Dept of Mech Eng, Technion Israel Inst of Tech, Technion City, Haifa 32000, Israel).This reviewer wishes to congratulate the author for writing this book. This combination of the three subjects, Metal Cutting Mechanics, Machine Tool Vibrations, and CNC Design under one roof, is actually done for the first time. Furthermore, integration of these three subjects gives the readers, students (mostly graduates), design engineers, as well as practitioners, a better outlook on the subject dealt with in the book Manufacturing Automation. The book is well written, and the sequence of subjects is perfect. The author was aware that each of the major subjects can fill up a book by itself, and he mentioned it in the introduction. Inserting a Problem Section after each chapter, emphasizing the main points discussed in it, turns the work into a textbook. However, it can also serve as a reference book for engineers and practitioners. Chapter 1 is a general introduction to manufacturing and a short overview of what one will find in this book chapter by chapter. Chapter 2 presents the mechanics of cutting. It is introduced under the most classical approach and written in an orderly and systematic way, except for the section on Milling and Tool Breakage which introduces a refreshing modern approach. Most of the equations are brought in their final form, which is quite acceptable for graduate students, engineers, and practitioners. The nomenclature and symbols are sometimes confusing; the author mixes old American standards with the ISO standards and puts them together in the same equation. This reviewer suggests that in future editions only ISO standard 3002/I through IV be considered. In this chapter, this reviewer missed the roles of Surface Finish and Tolerances in the cutting operations. Tool life is defined geometrically and not in a modern way, namely ``The tool terminates its life when it ceases to fulfill its function.'' In other words, the tool life ends on reaching the geometrical life (as defined in the book), or when the Surface Finish exceeds the demand and or the part is out of the defined Tolerance. It is a pity that the author did not include a section dealing with tool materials in this chapter. The materials composing the tool play a major role in the mechanics of cutting. For example, the contact length between tool and chip is a function of the tool's properties (primarily its thermal conductivity) and of other factors.In Chapter 3, the static and dynamic deformation in machining is treated in a very extensive and clear way that even this reviewer (whose field is not dynamics) could understand the factors and problems involved. The analysis presented emphasizes, by sample formulation, prediction of the magnitude and location of static deformation of bar turning and end milling. The section dealing with chatter is most impressively introduced. By introducing modal analysis techniques, the author shows how one can represent a complex machine tool structure using commonly used mathematical expressions and analyze the chatter as well as other sources of vibrations. In Chapter 4, the practical side of manufacturing is discussed. The author introduces the CNC technology and its principles of operation and leads the reader through NC programming of a part. The methodology of NC programming is well presented. All elements involved in CNC are discussed and theoretically supported. In the paragraph on Computer Assisted NC Part Programming, the author succeeded in showing in a compact and very clear form how complicated forms can be dealt with and successfully machined. The basics of Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is introduced. The author focuses on the teaching aspects of the subject. Chapter 5 contains conventional textbook material. The chapter is well written. The reader is led systematically through the various aspects of the CNC systems. A typical CNC machining center, including all necessary hardware, mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic and their combinations necessary to operate CNC systems, is well described. The various elements required, like machine tool drives, mechanical as well as electrical (and others), are described in detail and accompanied by the relevant formulation on which they are based upon. The mathematical modeling of drive systems is covered both in the time and frequency domain. The author directs some attention to the accuracy of the system. At the end of the chapter, the author presents an example of a design of an Electro-Hydraulic CNC Press Brake. The design contains the various elements of the system and may serve as a guide to the inexperienced reader (mostly students) while dealing with any CNC design. Chapter 6 is mostly an abstract of the author's research works in the area of Sensor Related Machining. This chapter is based on material published by the author in various publications. The dominant direction is the one established by Prof Tlusty. It might have been more fruitful if the author had discussed other approaches as well. Basic principles and techniques appear in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 7 contains the Laplace and z Transforms and includes several examples. In Chapter 8, the author introduces Off-Line and On-Line Parameters Estimation with Least Squares. At the end of the book, one can find a very extensive bibliography covering all aspects of the subjects discussed in the book. This reviewer recommends Manufacturing Automation: Metal Cutting Mechanics, Machine Tool Vibrations, and CNC Design as a textbook for students, undergraduate as well as graduate. It can also serve as an excellent reference book for those engaged in manufacturing, ie, engineers, technicians, and other practitioners.},

As robots come to work side by side with humans, they must also become human-aware. Over the past decade, research has made strides toward these goals. Progress has come from advances in visual and haptic perception and in mechanics in the form of soft actuators that offer a natural compliance. Most notably, immense progress in machine learning has been leveraged to encapsulate models of uncertainty and to support improvements in adaptive and robust control. Open questions remain in terms of how to enable robots to deal with the most unpredictable agent of all, the human.},

A set of tappered ball-end-mill tools (aka conical milling tools) is given as the input and the flank milling paths within user-defined tolerance are returned. Thespace of lines that admit tangential motion of an associated truncated cone along a general, doubly curved, free-form surface is explored. These lines serve as discrete positions of conical axes in 3D space. Spline surface fitting is used to generate a ruled surface that represents a single continuous sweep of a rigid conical milling tool. An optimization-based approach is then applied to globally minimize the error between the design surface and the conical envelope. The milling simulations are validated with physical experiments on two benchmark industrial datasets, reducing significantly the execution times while preserving or even reducing the milling error when compared to the state-of-the-art industrial software.},

 abstract = {Wire-feed additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising alternative to traditional subtractive manufacturing for fabricating large expensive metal components with complex geometry. The current research focus on wire-feed AM is trying to produce complex-shaped functional metal components with good geometry accuracy, surface finish and material property to meet the demanding requirements from aerospace, automotive and rapid tooling industry. Wire-feed AM processes generally involve high residual stresses and distortions due to the excessive heat input and high deposition rate. The influences of process conditions, such as energy input, wire-feed rate, welding speed, deposition pattern and deposition sequences, etc., on thermal history and resultant residual stresses of AM-processed components needs to be further understood. In addition, poor accuracy and surface finish of the process limit the applications of wire-feed AM technology. In this paper, after an introduction of various wire-feed AM technologies and its characteristics, an in depth review of various process aspects of wire-feed AM, including quality and accuracy of wire-feed AM processed components, will be presented. The overall objective is to identify the current challenges for wire-feed AM as well as point out the future research direction.},

@article{Duong.2021,
 abstract = {This paper is focused on investigating the joints jerk of industrial serial redundant manipulators with 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF) under the variation of the end-effector point (EEP) trajectory in the workspace. The EEP trajectories are initially built in the basic planes because of their simplicity, verification and experimentation are smooth, and most of the actual welded structures are performed on these basic planes. The jerk is determined by solving the inverse kinematics problem of the redundant system. This problem is solved based on the algorithm which is used for adjusting the increments of the generalized coordinate vector (AGV). The efficiency of this algorithm is shown through the error between a given trajectory and the recalculated trajectory through the forward kinematics problem. The result of this study allows us to evaluate the effect of the change of the trajectory on the kinematics characteristics of the robot in general and the jerk of the joints in particular. On the other hand, these results can be used as the basis for planning the EEP trajectory for redundant robots, developing algorithms to reduce joint jerky, increase the life of robot systems, and improve the accuracy of the redundant robot movement.},

@article{Iqbal.2020,
 abstract = {The successful realization of Industry 4.0 depends much on how coherently the cyber and physical realms are conjoined in cyber-physical systems. In the context of the fourth industrial revolution, research efforts have mostly been channeled toward the cyber domain, whereas the physical domain has received significantly lesser consideration. A physical domain generally comprises material shaping equipment, work material, tools, working medium, sensors, automation technology, and connectivity mechanisms. The article provides a comprehensive review of the published literature to establish the states of readiness of the two most important manufacturing technologies: subtractive and additive and their sustainable merger from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Rich potentials in the four characteristics at the process level: speed, sustainability, agility, and customer centricity and three at the system level: connectivity, data collection, and automation are required for a manufacturing system (physical domain) to be Industry 4.0 compatible. The review establishes that the subtractive manufacturing domain is nearly compatible regarding speed and agility but needs improvements in respect of sustainability and customer centricity. Additive manufacturing, on the other hand, appears strong on agility and customer-centricity fronts but needs amelioration regarding production speed and sustainability. In respect of the system level characteristics, both technologies seem to be compatible regarding automation, whereas significant improvements are required in connectivity and data sensing and collection. For the sake of raising compatibility levels of the manufacturing systems, subtractive-additive amalgamation is scrutinized. The amalgamation, especially in a done-in-one configuration, has, reportedly, succeeded to retain the favorable traits of the two manufacturing technologies, thus, bringing the merger much closer to the Industry 4.0 requirements. Proper process planning and optimal work distribution between the subtractive and additive modes are critical for operating an amalgamated system at high levels of the key characteristics.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses welding task sequencing for robot arc welding process planning. Although welding task sequencing is an essential step in welding process planning, it has been considered through empirical knowledge, rather than a systematic approach. Thus, an effective task sequencing method for robot arc welding is required. Welding operations can be classified by the number of weldlines and layers. Genetic algorithms are applied to tackle those welding task sequencing problems in productivity and welding quality aspects. A genetic algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is utilized to determine welding task sequencing for a multiweldline-singlepass problem. Further, welding task sequencing for multiweldline-multipass welding is investigated and appropriate genetic algorithms are introduced. A random key genetic algorithm is presented to solve multi-robot welding task sequencing: mutliweldline with multiple robots. Finally, the genetic algorithms are implemented for the welding task sequencing of three-dimensional weld plate assemblies. Various simulation tests for a welded structure are performed to find the combination of genetic algorithm parameters suitable to weld sequencing problems and to verify the quality of genetic algorithm solutions. Robot operations for weld sequences are simulated graphically using the robot simulation software IGRIP.},

@article{Kim.2003,
 abstract = {This paper introduces a 3-DOF translational parallel manipulator called Cartesian Parallel Manipulator (CPM). The manipulator consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three limbs. Each limb is made up of one prismatic and three revolute joints and all joint axes are parallel to one another. In this way, each limb provides two rotational constraints to the moving platform and the combined effects of the three limbs lead to an over-constrained mechanism with three translational degrees of freedom. The manipulator behaves like a conventional X-Y-Z Cartesian machine due to the orthogonal arrangement of the three limbs. Two actuation methods are analyzed. However, the rotary actuation method is discarded because of the existence of singularities within the workspace. For the linear actuation method, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the input and output displacements of the manipulator. The effects of misalignment of linear actuators on the motion of the moving platform are discussed. Each limb structure is exposed to a bending moment induced by external forces exerted on the moving platform. In order to minimize the deflection at the joints caused by the bending moment, a method to maximize the stiffness is suggested. A numerical example of the optimal design is presented.},

@article{Li.2018b,
 abstract = {In wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), it is crucial to maintain a constant travel speed in order to achieve a uniform bead morphology along the tool-path. However, this requirement is always violated in practice because the welding robot has to slow down when sharp corners with high curvatures are encountered so as to satisfy the dynamic constraint. The consequence is excessive fillings (i.e. humps) around these sharp corners, which not only increase the required post processing, but also prevent the continuation of the deposition process if the accumulated errors in the build direction become too large. This issue greatly limits the application of WAAM in the fabrication of complex-shaped components. In this paper, an adaptive process control scheme (APCS) capable of guaranteeing a uniform bead morphology while still respecting the dynamic constraint is proposed. First, the APCS divides the tool-path into several segments depending on whether they contain sharp corners. Then, for each segment, the APCS automatically selects the allowable travel speed subjected to the dynamic constraint, and also the wire-feed rate according to a process model established in advance. Through the matching between the travel speed and the wire-feed rate, a uniform bead morphology among different segments is achieved. Experiments were conducted on a gantry robot using the Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) process, controlled by a self-developed computer numerical control (CNC) system, validating the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

The construction and architecture sector sees the potential of AM especially in the free form design of steel components, such as force flow optimized nodes or bionic-inspired spaceframes. Robot-guided wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is capable of combining a high degree of automation and geometric freedom with high process efficiency. The build-up strategy (layer by layer) and the corresponding heat input influence the mechanical properties of the WAAM products. This study investigates the WAAM process by welding a bar regarding the build-up geometry, surface topography, and material properties. For tensile testing, an advanced testing procedure is applied to determine the strain fields and mechanical properties of the bars on the component and material scale.},

This study investigates the application of a special variant of artificial neural networks (ANNs), in particular, wavelet neural network (WNN) for tool wear monitoring in CNC end milling process of high-speed steel. A mixed level design of experiments with machining parameters of cutting speed, feed rate, cutting depth, and machining time is developed, from which 126 experiments are conducted. For each experiment, tool wear and surface roughness of machined workpiece are measured. The tool wear images are processed, and the descriptor of wear zone is extracted. The WNN is then applied to predict the flank wear of the cutting tool and compared with commonly used types of ANNs and the statistical model. Different input combinations with the inclusion of wear zone descriptor and surface roughness of machined parts are used to evaluate the performance of all models. Results show that the WNN with the input parameters of cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, machining time, and descriptor of wear zone predicts the degree of tool wear most accurately.},

@article{Paryanto.2015,
 abstract = {Reducing the energy consumption of industrial robots (IR) that are used in manufacturing systems has become a main focus in the development of green production systems. This is due to the reality that almost all automated manufacturing processes are using IR as the main component. Thus, reducing the energy consumption of IR will automatically reduce operating costs and CO2 emissions. Therefore, a method for reducing the energy consumption of IR in manufacturing systems is desired. Firstly, this paper presents a literature survey of the research in energy consumption analysis of IR that is used in manufacturing processes. The survey found that current research in this field is focused on the development of simulation models of IR that are able to be used to predict its energy consumption. Secondly, a modular model to analyze power consumption and dynamic behavior of IR is developed. Afterward, an experimental investigation is carried out to validate and estimate the accuracy of the model developed. The investigation shows that the developed modular model can be conveniently used to optimize the industrial robot's operating parameters, which are commonly needed for production planning and at the process optimization stage. In addition, the investigation shows that the process constraints, environment layout, productivity requirement, as well as the robot payload and operating speed are the key factors that must be considered for optimizing the productivity and efficiency of IR.},

@article{Pham.2018,
 abstract = {New industrial revolution - ``The 4th industrial revolution'' must be a remarkable milestone for the second decade of the twenty-first century. Many countries are competing to innovate their manufacturing chains for eco-friendly and energy-efficient productions. Although this green or sustainable manufacturing system evolves under the support of cyber-physical system (or digital twin) based on ICT technology, industrial robots also play important roles in this speedy, flexible and effective manufacturing chains. Recently, low-cost industrial robots or collaborative robots, are rising in a highly interactive environment with humans. Although an industrial robot consists of many important components such as mechanical parts (kinematic structure and reducer) and electric parts (servo motor, driver, sensors, and controller), precision reducer takes approximately 25{\%} of material-cost and governs important performance indices of industrial robots. This paper presents review of high precision reducers (HPRs) for industrial robots driving 4th industrial revolution. First, we provide HPRs market along with industrial robots. According to previous studies, HPRs for industrial robots can be classified based on their principles: planetary reducer, cycloid reducer, and harmonic drive (HD). Then, principle, characteristics, and three main performances (hysteresis, rotational transmission error (RTE) and efficiency) of HPRs are discussed. In addition, compensation methods overcoming accuracy limits of HPRs are summarized. Finally, other applications of HPRs except industrial robots are presented.},

@article{Rodrigues.2019,
 abstract = {Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the manufacturing paradigm in recent years due to the possibility of creating complex shaped three-dimensional parts which can be difficult or impossible to obtain by conventional manufacturing processes. Among the different additive manufacturing techniques, wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is suitable to produce large metallic parts owing to the high deposition rates achieved, which are significantly larger than powder-bed techniques, for example. The interest in WAAM is steadily increasing, and consequently, significant research efforts are underway. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the most significant achievements in WAAM, highlighting process developments and variants to control the microstructure, mechanical properties, and defect generation in the as-built parts; the most relevant engineering materials used; the main deposition strategies adopted to minimize residual stresses and the effect of post-processing heat treatments to improve the mechanical properties of the parts. An important aspect that still hinders this technology is certification and nondestructive testing of the parts, and this is discussed. Finally, a general perspective of future advancements is presented.},

When the resulting systems are found to be unsatisfactory for those who work with them, social scientists may be called upon to redesign jobs and working conditions. Only rarely is a sociotechnical approach employed, in which social and technical aspects are considered simultaneously. When it is, the details of the technology are usually not called into question, but only such matters as which of several commercially-available technologies should be used. The book describes an attempt to overcome this artificial and damaging separation of the technical and the human aspects of a new technology. A team comprising engineers, computer scientists, and a social scientist set out to develop jointly a human-centred machining system {\textquotedbl}in which operators are not subordinate to machines{\textquotedbl}.

This work presents a novel path planning approach that directly takes robot kinematics into account and thus ensures the reachability of all critical path poses. In an additional step, the planned path segments are smoothed so that joint velocity limits are respected. It is shown that the implemented path planner generates executable robot paths and at the same time maintains the process quality (in this case, sufficient coverage of the slice area). While the introduced method enables the generation of reachable printing paths, the smoothing algorithm allows for the execution of the path with respect to the robot's velocity limits and at the same time improves the slice coverage. Future experiments will show the realization of the real robot setup presented.},

First, the redundancy angle is described according to the self-motion characteristics of the manipulator, the position and orientation of the end-effector are separated, and the inverse kinematics of this manipulator is analyzed by geometric methods with the redundancy angle as a constraint. Then, the Jacobian matrix is established to derive the conditions for the kinematic singularities of the robotic arm by using the primitive matrix method and the block matrix method. Then, the kinematic singularities conditions in the joint space are mapped to the Cartesian space, and the singular configuration is described using the end poses and redundancy angles of the robotic arm, and a singularity avoidance method based on the redundancy angles and end pose is proposed. Finally, the correctness and feasibility of the inverse kinematics algorithm and the singularity avoidance method are verified by simulation examples.},

@article{Singh.2021,
 abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) refers to the virtual copy or model of any physical entity (physical twin) both of which are interconnected via exchange of data in real time. Conceptually, a DT mimics the state of its physical twin in real time and vice versa. Application of DT includes real-time monitoring, designing/planning, optimization, maintenance, remote access, etc. Its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. The advent of Industry 4.0 has brought complex industrial systems that are more autonomous, smart, and highly interconnected. These systems generate considerable amounts of data useful for several applications such as improving performance, predictive maintenance, training, etc. A sudden influx in the number of publications related to `Digital Twin' has led to confusion between different terminologies related to the digitalization of industries. Another problem that has arisen due to the growing popularity of DT is a lack of consensus on the description of DT as well as so many different types of DT, which adds to the confusion. This paper intends to consolidate the different types of DT and different definitions of DT throughout the literature for easy identification of DT from the rest of the complimentary terms such as `product avatar', `digital thread', `digital model', and `digital shadow'. The paper looks at the concept of DT since its inception to its predicted future to realize the value it can bring to certain sectors. Understanding the characteristics and types of DT while weighing its pros and cons is essential for any researcher, business, or sector before investing in the technology.},

@article{Tien.2021,
 abstract = {Online monitoring and optimisation of technological parameters are very effective methods of improving productivity and machining surface quality, especially in high-speed milling. During high-speed milling processes, cutting tools wear fast, leading to increased cutting forces and vibrations and decreased surface quality with increased power consumption. To investigate the effect of cutting forces and vibrations on high-speed milling processes, models for determining cutting forces and vibrations are presented in this paper. Stochastic tool wear was obtained from a probabilistic approach based on the combination of cutting force and systematic single-point vibration analyses. The singularity obtained from the vibration sensor signal is determined by the holder exponent (HE) through the wavelet transform maximum module. In addition, the nonlinear processes caused by the deformation and geometry of the cutting blade, the basis of selecting HE as an indicator to estimate the singularity points of the vibration signal, are also considered. To provide a model for predicting and optimising cutting forces, tool wear, vibrations, surface quality and power consumption, a new hybrid algorithm, i.e. back-propagation neural network and multi-objective particle swarm optimisation, was developed to determine the optimal cutting parameters to minimise the total power consumption, improve surface quality and increase tool life. High-speed milling experiments were conducted to confirm the accuracy and availability of the proposed multi-objective prediction and optimisation model. The improved optimisation method based on the proposed model can increase the surface quality and tool life by 5.95{\%} and 9.87{\%}, respectively. The power consumption can be reduced by 10.49{\%} compared to empirical selection.},

@article{Tunc.2017,
 abstract = {Robotic milling becomes increasingly relevant to large-scale part manufacturing industries thanks to its cost-effective and portable manufacturing concept compared to large-scale CNC machine tools. Integration of milling processes with industrial robots is proposed to be well aligned with the aims and objective of the recent fourth industrial revolution. However, the industrial robots introduce position-dependent and asymmetrical dynamic flexibility, which may reflect to the tool tip dynamics under several conditions. Under such circumstances, the stability limits become dependent on the machining location and the feed direction. In this respect, selection of machining tool path patterns is crucial for increased chatter-free material removal rates (MRR). This paper proposes an approach to evaluate and select tool path patterns, offered by the existing CAM packages, for increased chatter-free MRR. The machining area is divided into number of machining locations. The optimal feed direction is decided based on the absolute stability at each region considering the asymmetrical and position-dependent tool tip dynamics. Then, the alternative tool path patterns are evaluated and the corresponding optimum feed direction is decided for increased chatter-free material removal. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations and representative experiments.},

@article{Wang.2016,
 abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the suitability of stereolithography (SLA) to fabricate drug-loaded tablets with modified-release characteristics. The SLA printer creates solid objects by using a laser beam to photopolymerise monomers. In this work polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) was used as a monomer and diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide was used as a photo-initiator. 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) were selected as model drugs. Tablets were successfully printed and formulations with different properties were fabricated by adding polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300) to the printing solution. The loading of paracetamol and 4-ASA in the printed tablets was 5.69{\%} and 5.40{\%} respectively. In a realistic dynamic dissolution simulation of the gastrointestinal tract, drug release from the tablets was dependent on the composition of the formulations, but independent of dissolution pH. In conclusion SLA 3DP technology allows the manufacture of drug loaded tablets with specific extended-release profiles. In the future this technology could become a manufacturing technology for the elaboration of oral dosage forms, for industrial production or even for personalised dose.},

@article{Watson.2015,
 abstract = {This paper presents a simple computational model for determining whether additive manufacturing or subtractive manufacturing is more energy efficient for production of a given metallic part. The key discriminating variable is the fraction of the bounding envelope that contains material - i.e. the volume fraction of solid material. For both the additive process and the subtractive process, the total energy associated with the production of a part is defined in terms of the volume fraction of that part. The critical volume fraction is that for which the energy consumed by subtractive manufacturing equals the energy consumed by additive manufacturing. For volume fractions less than the critical value, additive manufacturing is more energy efficient. For volume fractions greater than the critical value, subtractive manufacturing is more efficient. The model considers the entire manufacturing lifecycle - from production and transport of feedstock material through processing to return of post-production scrap for recycling. Energy consumed by processing equipment while idle is also accounted for in the model. Although the individual energy components in the model are identified and accounted for in the expressions for additive and subtractive manufacturing, values for many of these components may not be currently available. Energy values for some materials' production and subtractive and additive manufacturing processes can be found in the literature. However, since many of these data are reported for a very specific application, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reliably apply these data to new process-material manufacturing scenarios since, very often, insufficient information is provided to enable extrapolation to broader use. Consequently, this paper also highlights the need to develop improved knowledge of the energy embodied in each phase of the manufacturing process. To be most valuable, users of the model should determine the energy consumed by their manufacturing process equipment on the basis of energy-per-unit-volume of production for each material of interest - considering both alloy composition and form. Energy consumed during machine idle per unit time should also be determined by the user then scaled to specific processing scenarios. Energy required to generate feedstock material (billet, plate, bar, wire, powder) must be obtained from suppliers.},

@article{Wickramasinghe.2020,
 abstract = {Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the fastest-growing additive manufacturing methods used in printing fibre-reinforced composites (FRC). The performances of the resulting printed parts are limited compared to those by other manufacturing methods due to their inherent defects. Hence, the effort to develop treatment methods to overcome these drawbacks has accelerated during the past few years. The main focus of this study is to review the impact of those defects on the mechanical performance of FRC and therefore to discuss the available treatment methods to eliminate or minimize them in order to enhance the functional properties of the printed parts. As FRC is a combination of polymer matrix material and continuous or short reinforcing fibres, this review will thoroughly discuss both thermoplastic polymers and FRCs printed via FDM technology, including the effect of printing parameters such as layer thickness, infill pattern, raster angle and fibre orientation. The most common defects on printed parts, in particular, the void formation, surface roughness and poor bonding between fibre and matrix, are explored. An inclusive discussion on the effectiveness of chemical, laser, heat and ultrasound treatments to minimize these drawbacks is provided by this review.},

 abstract = {Due to their high flexibility, large workspace, and high repeatability, industrial robots are widely used in roughing and semifinishing fields. However, their low machining accuracy and low stability limit further development of industrial robots in the machining field, with low stiffness being the most significant factor. The stiffness of industrial robots is affected by the joint deformation, transmission mechanism, friction, environment, and coupling of these factors. Moreover, the stiffness of a robot has a nonlinear distribution throughout the workspace, and external forces during processing cause irregular deviations of the robot, thereby affecting the machining accuracy and surface quality of the workpiece. Many scholars have researched identifying the stiffness of industrial robots and have proposed methods for improving the performance of industrial robots, mainly by optimizing the body structure of the robot and compensating for deformation errors with stiffness models. This paper reviews recent research on the stiffness modelling of industrial robots, which can be broadly classified as finite element analysis (FEA), matrix structure analysis (MSA), and virtual joint modelling (VJM) methods. Each method is studied from three aspects: algorithms, implementation, and limitations. In addition, common measurement techniques have been introduced for measuring deformation. Further research directions are also discussed.},

An intelligent agent named KMAIMOD was developed to automate SMP analysis and tool path generation based on operation controlled template (OCT) and feature machining volume semantics (FMVS). The framework of CAD/CAPP/CAM integration was introduced for automatic tool path generation. Then the working principle and machining process data analysis of KMAIMOD was proposed. And three categories of FMVS construction with machining elements were discussed to automatic determine machining position and range. In the experiments, some part models are utilized to verify the approach for automatic tool path generation, and the experimental results are analyzed at length to show the application effectiveness of the method.},
