\chapter{Implementation and Validation}%

The first step involves constructing a basic model that captures the kinematics and dynamics of an industrial robot. To test the method in a simple case, the first tests are performed on a 6-DoF model. After validation on this simple model, additional redundant degrees of freedom are introduced. After that, the method is connected to CAM software to be tested in more complex scenarios.

Once the basic mathematical model is established, various optimization algorithms are implemented to determine the optimal values for each parameter associated with the redundant degrees of freedom. These methods and optimization algorithms can consider the industrial robot's specific objectives and constraints, like energy consumption or joint accelerations.Â 


The validation process entails conducting real-world tests and simulations to evaluate optimized parameter performance and verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
