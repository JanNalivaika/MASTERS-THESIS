\section{\ZLlangGerEng{Thema}{Introduction and Motivation}}%


In the age of "Industrie 4.0", advanced technologies like digital twins, have greatly transformed industrial manufacturing \cite{Singh.2021}. A considerable amount of data can be gathered from various processes, like milling or 3D printing. By analyzing this data, it is possible to find new and optimized methods for efficient manufacturing \cite{Ghobakhloo.2020}. By doing so, a significant amount of resources, like time and money, can be saved while at the same time increasing the quality of the produced product \cite{Bibby.2018,Simonis.2016}.\newline
Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) has been introduced as a crucial tool to improve productivity and accuracy in creating customized products \cite{Feldhausen.2022}. CAM systems automate and optimize tasks such as machining, welding, and assembly \cite{LalitNarayan.2013b}. One of the key strengths of CAM lies in its precision and consistency, ensuring that intricate components are produced with minimal error. Furthermore, CAM systems contribute to increased efficiency by minimizing material waste and reducing production time~\cite{Dubovska.2014}. These capabilities play a significant role in achieving a carbon-neutral production process~\cite{Saxena.2020}. One of the most important areas of CAM is the calculation of the tool path in computer numerical control (CNC) machines as well as the movement and behavior of multi-axis industrial robots \cite{Pan}. \newline


Manufacturing machines are the backbone of modern industrial processes \cite{Bi.2020}. These machines encompass a wide range of equipment, from CNC machining centers to 3D printers and automated assembly lines. Their primary ability lies in precision and efficiency. CNC machines, for instance, can repeatedly produce intricate parts with high accuracy, reducing human error and ensuring consistency \cite{Jia.2018}. \newline
Industrial robots are a dominant part in the area of manufacturing as they can perform multi-axis movements that are needed to fulfill the customers wishes for individualized products \cite{Sherwani.2020}. They are cheaper to acquire compared to CNC milling machines but have their own set of disadvantages \cite{Iglesias.2015}. One advantage is the wide adaptability. They allow for quick reconfiguration to produce different components or products, promoting flexibility in manufacturing \cite{Billard.2019}. Further, advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have broadened their capabilities, enabling tasks that were once deemed too complex or hazardous for humans \cite{Goel.2020}. \newline

Achieving efficiency and sustainability in the current fast-changing environment requires a thorough analysis of the interdependent relationships between the manufactured part, process parameters, and boundary conditions that govern multi-axis robot programs \cite{Pan}. As the companies that work with industrial robots can place a strong emphasis on energy reduction, cost savings, or precision, optimizing these parameters is essential. CAM enables the simulation of the planned process, thus adapting any boundary conditions to fit the selected goals \cite{Kyratsis.2020,Maiti.2017}.
This thesis is focused on a methodical approach for analyzing process parameters and optimizing boundary conditions in multi-axis robot programs \cite{Pan}. 

\section{\ZLlangGerEng{Stand der Wissenschaft und Technik}{State of Science and Technology}}%
The following chapter gives a brief introduction to the topics of manufacturing methods and CAM, as well as a first look into the available optimization methods for various process parameters. 
\subsection{Manufacturing Methods}
Manufacturing methods encompass a variety of techniques utilized to manufacture functional components and products. Two noteworthy approaches are subtractive and additive manufacturing \cite{Iqbal.2020}. Subtractive manufacturing, closely related to traditional machining, requires the removal of material from a solid workpiece to attain the desired shape \cite{Watson.2015}. This process typically employs cutting tools like drills and mills.

Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, uses digital designs to build objects in layers. This technique provides remarkable design flexibility, minimizes material waste, and enables the creation of intricate geometries \cite{Dilberoglu.2017}. Subtractive and additive manufacturing methods have unique advantages and applications that make them indispensable in modern industrial processes. They play a significant role in the advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies \cite{Bandyopadhyay.2020, vanLe.2017}.



\subsubsection{Subtractive Manufacturing}
Milling is a sophisticated machining process that plays a central role in modern industrial production. It relies on the precision and automation of CNC technology to machine intricate shapes and components with precise accuracy \cite{Jayawardane.2023}. A CNC milling machine, guided by computer programs, manipulates cutting tools to shape workpieces according to design specifications with tight tolerances. This technology facilitates the creation of high-precision parts and prototypes \cite{Amanullah.2017}. The integration of CNC technology and milling processes has pushed the era of manufacturing towards higher efficiency and the ability to realize increasingly complex and innovative designs~\cite{Wang.2023}.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Additive Manufacturing}
Additive Manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, stands in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC milling. Instead of removing material to create a part, additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer, adding material precisely where needed. This approach has opened up new possibilities in terms of design freedom, customization, and efficiency \cite{Prakash.2018}.

The Layer-by-Layer approach in AM encompasses various technologies like Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). This layering enables the creation of complex geometries that would be extremely challenging or impossible to produce using traditional methods \cite{Abdulhameed.2019}.
A second advantage of AM is its compatibility with a wide range of materials, from plastics and metals to ceramics and even bio-materials \cite{Bose.2018}. This versatility allows for the production of components with diverse properties, including strength, flexibility, and heat resistance. One of the most significant advantages of AM is the freedom it offers in design. Traditional manufacturing methods often involve design constraints due to the limitations of tools and processes. With AM, designers have more creative liberty, which can lead to innovative and lightweight structures, improved functionality, and optimized performance \cite{Plocher.2019}.
Despite its many benefits, AM also presents challenges such as post-processing requirements (e.g., smoothing or heat treatment for some materials), limited material options for certain applications, and production speed for large or complex parts~\cite{Dilberoglu.2017}.

AM has found applications across numerous industries, including aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and consumer goods. As AM technologies advance, they have the potential to transform supply chains, enable distributed manufacturing, and redefine the approach of the creation of products and components \cite{Haleem.2019}.
\subsubsection{Computer-Aided Manufacturing}\label{CAM}
CAM is used to automatically generate tool paths for CNC machines \cite{Ding.2004, Feldhausen.2022}. The CAM software considers the models of the raw and finished part as well as the constraints of the machine, the tools, and the manufacturing technology. Together with user-configurable parameters, tool paths for 3-axis, 5-axis, and robot-based machine tools are generated \cite{Nee.2015}. The growing demand for flexibility in machine tools, such as the use of multiple manufacturing technologies in one machine or automated loading and unloading, has led to many machine tools being equipped with additional mechanical axes \cite{Li.2015c,Lee.2017}. Examples include robots mounted on linear axes and rotary-tilt tables.
The tool paths created in CAM programs are usually defined by five degrees of freedom. The first three are the translational axes X, Y, and Z. The tilting and inclining of the tool are defined by the A- and B-axes. Occasionally, an additional rotation of the tool (C-axis) around the Z-axis (e.g., for dragging a swivel knife) is defined \cite{Zhu.2012}. Machines with more degrees of freedom than those limited by the tool-path often need user-defined constraints \cite{Pan}. These constraints are necessary to fully specify the movements of the machine axes. An example is the alignment of a part using the rotary-tilt table so that the Z-axis of the tool always points in the direction of gravity. This is helpful in processes like fused deposition modeling (FDM) and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). 
It is common practice to set the user-defined constraints based on experience. A preliminary literature review indicates that the configuration of these degrees of freedom has an impact on the energy demand and stability of the process \cite{Paryanto.2015,Hirzinger.2005, Pham.2018,Cvitanic.2020}. 
\newpage



\subsubsection{CNC Machining}
CNC machines is essential in modern machining and has revolutionized manufacturing. At its core, CNC uses computers to control machining tools and equipment, resulting in increased precision, efficiency, and repeatability in manufacturing processes, especially milling. CNC machining relies on precise instructions programmed into a computer \cite{Altintas.2001}. These instructions, frequently developed utilizing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, delineates the necessary movement, tool alteration, and parameter adjustment for the machining procedure \cite{Klancnik.2016}. This automation level guarantees precise and consistent results, eliminating human error and enabling the production of complex and highly detailed parts.

G-code \cite{DIN66025} is a set of commands and coordinates that provide direction to the CNC machine. It specifies tool-paths, tool changes, and spindle speeds, among other parameters, and is generated by CAM software from 3D CAD models, taking into account tool-paths, speeds, feeds, and other parameters \cite{cnckonw}.
The CNC controller interprets the G-code instructions and translates them into precise movements and tool actions. It serves as a mediator between the computer program and the physical machining equipment \cite{Adam.2022}. CNC technology is highly versatile, encompassing not only milling but also a range of machining processes such as waterjet cutting or electrical discharge machining. Its uses span various industries, including aerospace, automotive manufacturing, medical device fabrication, and custom prototyping.% CNC machines can work with a wide variety of materials, from metals like aluminum and titanium to plastics and composites.
%The continuous advancement of CNC technology, including the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the development of multi-axis machines, enhances its capabilities. These innovations enable more complex geometries, faster production rates, and tighter tolerances. As a result, CNC machining has become an essential tool in modern manufacturing, driving innovation and enabling the creation of intricate and high-precision components across various industries.
\subsection{Industrial Robots}
Industrial robots are crucial to modern manufacturing and automation, transforming production methods and repetitive task performance across diverse industries. Since their inception in the mid-20th century, these machines have undergone significant advancements, evolving into highly adaptive and sophisticated devices that promote productivity, accuracy, and safety within manufacturing processes~\cite{Ji.2019}.
At their core, industrial robots are programmable machines designed to execute tasks with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. They can carry out repetitive actions consistently, which enhances productivity and reduces the risk of human error \cite{Siciliano.2016}. 

One key aspect in industrial robotics is the continuous path mode, which enables robots to smoothly and continuously follow a path that deviates from the set way points \cite{Chen.2017}. This feature is especially interesting in areas where the path of a tool is rapidly changing its direction and would require significant moments and forces to reach all set way points during a continuous motion.
This feature is helpful for improvement fluidity of the movement as well as energy reduction. In applications such as welding or painting, significant velocity changes result in parts that are manufactured not to the desired specification \cite{Bigliardi.2023}. 
\newpage
The robots performance relies on sophisticated control algorithms and feedback systems that allow them to adapt to dynamic conditions, adjust movements in real-time, and maintain a consistently high level of accuracy \cite{Lin.2023}. This improves both the quality of the final product and the safety of the manufacturing process, as robots can navigate complex paths without risking collisions or accidents~\cite{Bosscher.2011}.
As technology continues to advance, industrial robots will play an even more prominent role in shaping the future of manufacturing and automation \cite{Domae.2019}.


\subsection{Process Parameters in WAAM}
Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is an additive manufacturing process that uses an industrial robot combined with a welding machine to deposit metal material layer by layer to build up a three-dimensional object \cite{Rodrigues.2019}. Process parameters in WAAM are critical for achieving the desired quality and properties in the final product \cite{Dinovitzer.2019}.

In simple terms, the amount of electrical current and voltage supplied to the welding arc affects the heat input and melting rate. Adjusting the welding current can control the size and penetration depth of the weld bead \cite{Tomar.2022}. In a more detailed view, Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) technology, has a substantial  number of parameters that can be tuned to achieve a desired result \cite{Selvi.2018}.   

The rate at which the filler wire is fed into the weld pool influences the deposition rate and the size of the weld bead. Proper wire feed is essential for maintaining a uniform weld. Optimizing these process parameters is essential for achieving the desired mechanical properties, surface finish, and dimensional accuracy in WAAM-produced parts. Fine-tuning these parameters may require experimentation and monitoring to ensure consistent and high-quality results \cite{Muller.2019}.

In the context of WAAM with industrial robots, various robot-specific parameters and considerations play a crucial role in the overall process. The type and model of the industrial robot being used can impact the range of motion, payload capacity, and precision. The robot's kinematic configuration, such as whether it's a Cartesian, articulated, or other type, affects its ability to reach different areas of the workpiece. Controlling the robot's speed and acceleration during deposition and tool-path execution is essential for maintaining precision~\cite{Hsiao.2020}.

Especially in situations with more degrees of freedom than required, as described in chapter~\ref{CAM}, setting the right process parameters can significantly influence the process.
Table \ref{parameter} gives an overview of the parameters that can be influenced by setting different boundary conditions.

\newpage
%Developing robot programs for precise toolpath execution, including considerations for adaptive path planning to accommodate irregular geometries, is a fundamental aspect of WAAM.
These robot-specific parameters and considerations are essential for achieving the desired precision, quality, and efficiency in WAAM processes. Integrating the robot effectively into the manufacturing system and optimizing its parameters are key factors for efficient and precise production.

\subsection{Comparison of Available Process Optimization Methods}

As mentioned in chapter \ref{CAM}, one of the most simple approaches is to define the configuration of the robot manually. These settings are mostly based on experience and intuition and are not quantified numerically. Additionally, multiple iterations can be necessary to find the right settings \cite{Pan}.\newline
Processes like spot welding can be regarded as a travelling salesman problem. As of now , no CAM software is currently able to optimally solve this problem and optimize for a fast cycle time \cite{Pan}. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is proposed in \cite{Kim.2002}.\newline
One of the more analyzed areas is the reduction of energy use \cite{Halevi.2011, Li.2015}. When the number of actuators (degrees of freedom) exceeds the available degrees of freedom in the motion of the end-effector, the end-effector path does not fully determine the trajectories of all individual degrees of freedom. This redundancy can be leveraged to optimize performance, such as in reducing maneuvering time. Control theory is employed to determine the ideal allocation of motion across the actuators while considering physical constraints for a given path of the end-effector. The simulation results demonstrate a substantial decrease in energy consumption \cite{Halevi.2011}.

Another approach discusses parallel mechanisms. They have advantages such as fast motion and the ability to carry heavier payloads compared to serial mechanisms. One method to overcome singularity configurations is to use redundantly actuated parallel mechanisms (RAPMs), which have more actuators than the kinematic degrees of freedom. This feature can be used for applications like active stiffness enhancement, backlash elimination, and motion generation. It is investigated how RAPMs can increase energy efficiency by distributing actuating torques optimally. Comparing the energy consumption of a RAPM and a non-redundantly actuated mechanism for the same pathway, it is shown that a RAPM can consume less energy with proper torque distribution \cite{Lee.2015}. 


A different study aims to minimize energy consumption during pick-and-place operations by optimizing motion planning. The research uses a PID controller for optimal parameters and fine-tunes them using metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization. The results show that the combination of these approaches improves compatibility in terms of execution time and energy efficiency. Experiments conducted on a dual-arm robot validate the feasibility of the algorithms. Combining robot configuration with metaheuristic approaches leads to energy and time savings compared to using PID controllers alone for motion planning \cite{Nonoyama.2022}.

\newpage
\section{\ZLlangGerEng{Ziele der Arbeit}{Objective of the Thesis}}%
The definition of the redundant constraints, mentioned in chapter \ref{CAM}, does not affect the relative tool path as generated by the CAM software. As such, a methodical approach to optimize these constraints, without altering the toolpath, in terms of efficiency, speed, and energy demand of the machine is required. Currently, no literature provides a comprehensive analysis or methodology regarding this global optimization problem.
This work aims to attain a methodical approach that analyzes a set of constraints and evaluates the influence of those constraints on a set of defined process variables. It will focus on a 6-axis robot with a rotary-tilt table, whereby the results should also be transferable to other machines. Furthermore, the experiments and validations will be limited to the manufacturing processes of WAAM and milling. 


First, the influence of the constraints on relevant process variables (energy demand, joint turnover, speed and acceleration peaks, total joint movements) in a manufacturing process such as WAAM will be assessed. Subsequently, a process evaluation will be elaborated in the CAM software, by means of which the process quality can be determined. Depending on the respective process variables, approximation methods or machine learning methods will be investigated for the process evaluation. The process quality as a one-dimensional variable will be determined by weighting the process variables. Subsequently, a method for the optimization of the constraints will be elaborated. This task corresponds to an optimization problem in which the process quality will be maximized by selecting suitable constraints.
