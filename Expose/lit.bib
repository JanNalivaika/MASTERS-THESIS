@article{Abele.2012,
 abstract = {Industrial robots are used in a great variety of applications for handling, welding and milling operations. They represent a cost-saving and flexible alternative for machining applications. A reduced pose and path accuracy, especially under process force load due to the high mechanical compliance, restrict the use of industrial robots for further machining applications. Test results showed that these deviations range up to 0.6{\&}nbsp;mm. In this paper, a method is presented to determine the resulting path deviation of the robot under process force by using a structured light scanner. The obtained data is compared with the CAD (Computer Aided Design) data of the machined part within a developed software module. Additionally, the developed module provides functions for manipulation, registration of STL (Surface Tessellation Language) surface point clouds and a postprocessor for program translation. The comparison is performed using a dexel discretization of each data set. Based on this comparison the robot path is adapted to improve the machining quality. This method can be applied to 3- and 5-axis machining operations. The results show that the deviation can be reduced to 0.1{\&}nbsp;mm.},

@article{Altintas.2001,
 abstract = {9R15. Manufacturing Automation: Metal Cutting Mechanics, Machine Tool Vibrations, and CNC Design. - Y Altintas (Manuf Autom Lab, Univ of British Columbia, Canada). Cambridge UP, Cambridge, UK. 2000. 286 pp. Softcover. ISBN 0-521-65973-6. {\$}39.95.Reviewed by AA Ber (Dept of Mech Eng, Technion Israel Inst of Tech, Technion City, Haifa 32000, Israel).This reviewer wishes to congratulate the author for writing this book. This combination of the three subjects, Metal Cutting Mechanics, Machine Tool Vibrations, and CNC Design under one roof, is actually done for the first time. Furthermore, integration of these three subjects gives the readers, students (mostly graduates), design engineers, as well as practitioners, a better outlook on the subject dealt with in the book Manufacturing Automation. The book is well written, and the sequence of subjects is perfect. The author was aware that each of the major subjects can fill up a book by itself, and he mentioned it in the introduction. Inserting a Problem Section after each chapter, emphasizing the main points discussed in it, turns the work into a textbook. However, it can also serve as a reference book for engineers and practitioners. Chapter 1 is a general introduction to manufacturing and a short overview of what one will find in this book chapter by chapter. Chapter 2 presents the mechanics of cutting. It is introduced under the most classical approach and written in an orderly and systematic way, except for the section on Milling and Tool Breakage which introduces a refreshing modern approach. Most of the equations are brought in their final form, which is quite acceptable for graduate students, engineers, and practitioners. The nomenclature and symbols are sometimes confusing; the author mixes old American standards with the ISO standards and puts them together in the same equation. This reviewer suggests that in future editions only ISO standard 3002/I through IV be considered. In this chapter, this reviewer missed the roles of Surface Finish and Tolerances in the cutting operations. Tool life is defined geometrically and not in a modern way, namely ``The tool terminates its life when it ceases to fulfill its function.'' In other words, the tool life ends on reaching the geometrical life (as defined in the book), or when the Surface Finish exceeds the demand and or the part is out of the defined Tolerance. It is a pity that the author did not include a section dealing with tool materials in this chapter. The materials composing the tool play a major role in the mechanics of cutting. For example, the contact length between tool and chip is a function of the tool's properties (primarily its thermal conductivity) and of other factors.In Chapter 3, the static and dynamic deformation in machining is treated in a very extensive and clear way that even this reviewer (whose field is not dynamics) could understand the factors and problems involved. The analysis presented emphasizes, by sample formulation, prediction of the magnitude and location of static deformation of bar turning and end milling. The section dealing with chatter is most impressively introduced. By introducing modal analysis techniques, the author shows how one can represent a complex machine tool structure using commonly used mathematical expressions and analyze the chatter as well as other sources of vibrations. In Chapter 4, the practical side of manufacturing is discussed. The author introduces the CNC technology and its principles of operation and leads the reader through NC programming of a part. The methodology of NC programming is well presented. All elements involved in CNC are discussed and theoretically supported. In the paragraph on Computer Assisted NC Part Programming, the author succeeded in showing in a compact and very clear form how complicated forms can be dealt with and successfully machined. The basics of Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is introduced. The author focuses on the teaching aspects of the subject. Chapter 5 contains conventional textbook material. The chapter is well written. The reader is led systematically through the various aspects of the CNC systems. A typical CNC machining center, including all necessary hardware, mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic and their combinations necessary to operate CNC systems, is well described. The various elements required, like machine tool drives, mechanical as well as electrical (and others), are described in detail and accompanied by the relevant formulation on which they are based upon. The mathematical modeling of drive systems is covered both in the time and frequency domain. The author directs some attention to the accuracy of the system. At the end of the chapter, the author presents an example of a design of an Electro-Hydraulic CNC Press Brake. The design contains the various elements of the system and may serve as a guide to the inexperienced reader (mostly students) while dealing with any CNC design. Chapter 6 is mostly an abstract of the author's research works in the area of Sensor Related Machining. This chapter is based on material published by the author in various publications. The dominant direction is the one established by Prof Tlusty. It might have been more fruitful if the author had discussed other approaches as well. Basic principles and techniques appear in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 7 contains the Laplace and z Transforms and includes several examples. In Chapter 8, the author introduces Off-Line and On-Line Parameters Estimation with Least Squares. At the end of the book, one can find a very extensive bibliography covering all aspects of the subjects discussed in the book. This reviewer recommends Manufacturing Automation: Metal Cutting Mechanics, Machine Tool Vibrations, and CNC Design as a textbook for students, undergraduate as well as graduate. It can also serve as an excellent reference book for those engaged in manufacturing, ie, engineers, technicians, and other practitioners.},

Progress has come from advances in visual and haptic perception and in mechanics in the form of soft actuators that offer a natural compliance. Most notably, immense progress in machine learning has been leveraged to encapsulate models of uncertainty and to support improvements in adaptive and robust control.

@article{Iqbal.2020,
 abstract = {The successful realization of Industry 4.0 depends much on how coherently the cyber and physical realms are conjoined in cyber-physical systems. In the context of the fourth industrial revolution, research efforts have mostly been channeled toward the cyber domain, whereas the physical domain has received significantly lesser consideration. A physical domain generally comprises material shaping equipment, work material, tools, working medium, sensors, automation technology, and connectivity mechanisms. The article provides a comprehensive review of the published literature to establish the states of readiness of the two most important manufacturing technologies: subtractive and additive and their sustainable merger from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Rich potentials in the four characteristics at the process level: speed, sustainability, agility, and customer centricity and three at the system level: connectivity, data collection, and automation are required for a manufacturing system (physical domain) to be Industry 4.0 compatible. The review establishes that the subtractive manufacturing domain is nearly compatible regarding speed and agility but needs improvements in respect of sustainability and customer centricity. Additive manufacturing, on the other hand, appears strong on agility and customer-centricity fronts but needs amelioration regarding production speed and sustainability. In respect of the system level characteristics, both technologies seem to be compatible regarding automation, whereas significant improvements are required in connectivity and data sensing and collection. For the sake of raising compatibility levels of the manufacturing systems, subtractive-additive amalgamation is scrutinized. The amalgamation, especially in a done-in-one configuration, has, reportedly, succeeded to retain the favorable traits of the two manufacturing technologies, thus, bringing the merger much closer to the Industry 4.0 requirements. Proper process planning and optimal work distribution between the subtractive and additive modes are critical for operating an amalgamated system at high levels of the key characteristics.},

@article{Kim.2002,
 abstract = {This paper addresses welding task sequencing for robot arc welding process planning. Although welding task sequencing is an essential step in welding process planning, it has been considered through empirical knowledge, rather than a systematic approach. Thus, an effective task sequencing method for robot arc welding is required. Welding operations can be classified by the number of weldlines and layers. Genetic algorithms are applied to tackle those welding task sequencing problems in productivity and welding quality aspects. A genetic algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is utilized to determine welding task sequencing for a multiweldline-singlepass problem. Further, welding task sequencing for multiweldline-multipass welding is investigated and appropriate genetic algorithms are introduced. A random key genetic algorithm is presented to solve multi-robot welding task sequencing: mutliweldline with multiple robots. Finally, the genetic algorithms are implemented for the welding task sequencing of three-dimensional weld plate assemblies. Various simulation tests for a welded structure are performed to find the combination of genetic algorithm parameters suitable to weld sequencing problems and to verify the quality of genetic algorithm solutions. Robot operations for weld sequences are simulated graphically using the robot simulation software IGRIP.},

 abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) in industrial applications benefits from increasing interest due to its automation potential and its flexibility in manufacturing complex structures. The construction and architecture sector sees the potential of AM especially in the free form design of steel components, such as force flow optimized nodes or bionic-inspired spaceframes. Robot-guided wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is capable of combining a high degree of automation and geometric freedom with high process efficiency. The build-up strategy (layer by layer) and the corresponding heat input influence the mechanical properties of the WAAM products. This study investigates the WAAM process by welding a bar regarding the build-up geometry, surface topography, and material properties. For tensile testing, an advanced testing procedure is applied to determine the strain fields and mechanical properties of the bars on the component and material scale.},

@article{Paryanto.2015,
 abstract = {Reducing the energy consumption of industrial robots (IR) that are used in manufacturing systems has become a main focus in the development of green production systems. This is due to the reality that almost all automated manufacturing processes are using IR as the main component. Thus, reducing the energy consumption of IR will automatically reduce operating costs and CO2 emissions. Therefore, a method for reducing the energy consumption of IR in manufacturing systems is desired. Firstly, this paper presents a literature survey of the research in energy consumption analysis of IR that is used in manufacturing processes. The survey found that current research in this field is focused on the development of simulation models of IR that are able to be used to predict its energy consumption. Secondly, a modular model to analyze power consumption and dynamic behavior of IR is developed. Afterward, an experimental investigation is carried out to validate and estimate the accuracy of the model developed. The investigation shows that the developed modular model can be conveniently used to optimize the industrial robot's operating parameters, which are commonly needed for production planning and at the process optimization stage. In addition, the investigation shows that the process constraints, environment layout, productivity requirement, as well as the robot payload and operating speed are the key factors that must be considered for optimizing the productivity and efficiency of IR.},

@article{Pham.2018,
 abstract = {New industrial revolution - ``The 4th industrial revolution'' must be a remarkable milestone for the second decade of the twenty-first century. Many countries are competing to innovate their manufacturing chains for eco-friendly and energy-efficient productions. Although this green or sustainable manufacturing system evolves under the support of cyber-physical system (or digital twin) based on ICT technology, industrial robots also play important roles in this speedy, flexible and effective manufacturing chains. Recently, low-cost industrial robots or collaborative robots, are rising in a highly interactive environment with humans. Although an industrial robot consists of many important components such as mechanical parts (kinematic structure and reducer) and electric parts (servo motor, driver, sensors, and controller), precision reducer takes approximately 25{\%} of material-cost and governs important performance indices of industrial robots. This paper presents review of high precision reducers (HPRs) for industrial robots driving 4th industrial revolution. First, we provide HPRs market along with industrial robots. According to previous studies, HPRs for industrial robots can be classified based on their principles: planetary reducer, cycloid reducer, and harmonic drive (HD). Then, principle, characteristics, and three main performances (hysteresis, rotational transmission error (RTE) and efficiency) of HPRs are discussed. In addition, compensation methods overcoming accuracy limits of HPRs are summarized. Finally, other applications of HPRs except industrial robots are presented.},

 abstract = {Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the manufacturing paradigm in recent years due to the possibility of creating complex shaped three-dimensional parts which can be difficult or impossible to obtain by conventional manufacturing processes. Among the different additive manufacturing techniques, wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is suitable to produce large metallic parts owing to the high deposition rates achieved, which are significantly larger than powder-bed techniques, for example. The interest in WAAM is steadily increasing, and consequently, significant research efforts are underway. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the most significant achievements in WAAM, highlighting process developments and variants to control the microstructure, mechanical properties, and defect generation in the as-built parts; the most relevant engineering materials used; the main deposition strategies adopted to minimize residual stresses and the effect of post-processing heat treatments to improve the mechanical properties of the parts. An important aspect that still hinders this technology is certification and nondestructive testing of the parts, and this is discussed. Finally, a general perspective of future advancements is presented.},

 abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) refers to the virtual copy or model of any physical entity (physical twin) both of which are interconnected via exchange of data in real time. Conceptually, a DT mimics the state of its physical twin in real time and vice versa. Application of DT includes real-time monitoring, designing/planning, optimization, maintenance, remote access, etc. Its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. The advent of Industry 4.0 has brought complex industrial systems that are more autonomous, smart, and highly interconnected. These systems generate considerable amounts of data useful for several applications such as improving performance, predictive maintenance, training, etc. A sudden influx in the number of publications related to `Digital Twin' has led to confusion between different terminologies related to the digitalization of industries. Another problem that has arisen due to the growing popularity of DT is a lack of consensus on the description of DT as well as so many different types of DT, which adds to the confusion. This paper intends to consolidate the different types of DT and different definitions of DT throughout the literature for easy identification of DT from the rest of the complimentary terms such as `product avatar', `digital thread', `digital model', and `digital shadow'. The paper looks at the concept of DT since its inception to its predicted future to realize the value it can bring to certain sectors. Understanding the characteristics and types of DT while weighing its pros and cons is essential for any researcher, business, or sector before investing in the technology.},

@article{Watson.2015,
 abstract = {This paper presents a simple computational model for determining whether additive manufacturing or subtractive manufacturing is more energy efficient for production of a given metallic part. The key discriminating variable is the fraction of the bounding envelope that contains material - i.e. the volume fraction of solid material. For both the additive process and the subtractive process, the total energy associated with the production of a part is defined in terms of the volume fraction of that part. The critical volume fraction is that for which the energy consumed by subtractive manufacturing equals the energy consumed by additive manufacturing. For volume fractions less than the critical value, additive manufacturing is more energy efficient. For volume fractions greater than the critical value, subtractive manufacturing is more efficient. The model considers the entire manufacturing lifecycle - from production and transport of feedstock material through processing to return of post-production scrap for recycling. Energy consumed by processing equipment while idle is also accounted for in the model. Although the individual energy components in the model are identified and accounted for in the expressions for additive and subtractive manufacturing, values for many of these components may not be currently available. Energy values for some materials' production and subtractive and additive manufacturing processes can be found in the literature. However, since many of these data are reported for a very specific application, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reliably apply these data to new process-material manufacturing scenarios since, very often, insufficient information is provided to enable extrapolation to broader use. Consequently, this paper also highlights the need to develop improved knowledge of the energy embodied in each phase of the manufacturing process. To be most valuable, users of the model should determine the energy consumed by their manufacturing process equipment on the basis of energy-per-unit-volume of production for each material of interest - considering both alloy composition and form. Energy consumed during machine idle per unit time should also be determined by the user then scaled to specific processing scenarios. Energy required to generate feedstock material (billet, plate, bar, wire, powder) must be obtained from suppliers.},
