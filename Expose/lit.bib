 abstract = {Industrial robots are used in a great variety of applications for handling, welding and milling operations. They represent a cost-saving and flexible alternative for machining applications. A reduced pose and path accuracy, especially under process force load due to the high mechanical compliance, restrict the use of industrial robots for further machining applications. Test results showed that these deviations range up to 0.6{\&}nbsp;mm. In this paper, a method is presented to determine the resulting path deviation of the robot under process force by using a structured light scanner. The obtained data is compared with the CAD (Computer Aided Design) data of the machined part within a developed software module. Additionally, the developed module provides functions for manipulation, registration of STL (Surface Tessellation Language) surface point clouds and a postprocessor for program translation. The comparison is performed using a dexel discretization of each data set. Based on this comparison the robot path is adapted to improve the machining quality. This method can be applied to 3- and 5-axis machining operations. The results show that the deviation can be reduced to 0.1{\&}nbsp;mm.},

@article{Kim.2002,
 abstract = {This paper addresses welding task sequencing for robot arc welding process planning. Although welding task sequencing is an essential step in welding process planning, it has been considered through empirical knowledge, rather than a systematic approach. Thus, an effective task sequencing method for robot arc welding is required. Welding operations can be classified by the number of weldlines and layers. Genetic algorithms are applied to tackle those welding task sequencing problems in productivity and welding quality aspects. A genetic algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is utilized to determine welding task sequencing for a multiweldline-singlepass problem. Further, welding task sequencing for multiweldline-multipass welding is investigated and appropriate genetic algorithms are introduced. A random key genetic algorithm is presented to solve multi-robot welding task sequencing: mutliweldline with multiple robots. Finally, the genetic algorithms are implemented for the welding task sequencing of three-dimensional weld plate assemblies. Various simulation tests for a welded structure are performed to find the combination of genetic algorithm parameters suitable to weld sequencing problems and to verify the quality of genetic algorithm solutions. Robot operations for weld sequences are simulated graphically using the robot simulation software IGRIP.},
